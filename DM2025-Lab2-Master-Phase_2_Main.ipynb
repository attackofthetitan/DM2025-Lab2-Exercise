      "\n",
      "### 1. The Structure: Layers of \"Neurons\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A neural network is made of layers of interconnected nodes, or \"neurons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Input Layer:** Takes in the raw data. For an image, each neuron might hold the brightness of one pixel.\n",
      "*   **Hidden Layers:** This is where the \"thinking\" happens. Each neuron in these layers receives signals from the previous layer, does a simple calculation, and passes a new signal forward. Early layers might learn to recognize simple features like edges or colors, while deeper layers combine those to recognize more complex things like eyes, ears, or shapes.\n",
      "*   **Output Layer:** Produces the final result. For example, it might have two neurons: one for \"Cat\" and one for \"Dog.\" The one that activates more strongly is the network's answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Learning Process (Training)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the magic part. The network learns by making a guess, checking how wrong it was, and adjusting itself to be less wrong next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Make a Guess:** You show the network an image of a cat. At first, its internal connections are random, so its guess is a complete toss-up (e.g., \"40% Cat, 60% Dog\").\n",
      "2.  **Calculate the Error:** You compare the network's guess to the correct label (\"100% Cat\"). The difference is the \"error.\"\n",
      "3.  **Adjust Connections:** The network then works backward from the error and slightly adjusts the strength of all its internal connections. Connections that contributed to the *wrong* answer are weakened, and connections that helped lead to the *right* answer are strengthened.\n",
      "4.  **Repeat Millions of Times:** You repeat this process with thousands or millions of labeled examples (cat photos, dog photos, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. The Result: A Trained Network\n",
      "\n",
      "After countless cycles of guessing, checking, and adjusting, the network's connections are no longer random. They have been fine-tuned to recognize the specific patterns that define a \"cat\" or a \"dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When you show it a **new** image it has never seen before, it can now make a highly accurate prediction because it has learned the general features of the objects it was trained on.\n"

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",

       "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nrogerebert.com\\nEdge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) |\\nRoger Ebert\\n8–10 minutes\\n“Edge of Tomorrow” is less of a time travel movie than an experience\\nmovie; that statement might not make sense now, but it probably will after\\nyou’ve seen it. Based on Hiroshi Sikurazaka’s novel “All You Need is Kill”,\\nit’s a true science fiction film, highly conceptual, set during the aftermath of\\nan alien invasion. Maybe “extra-dimensional being invasion” is more\\naccurate. The fierce, octopod-looking beasties known as Mimics are\\ncontrolled hive-mind style by a creature that seems able to peer through\\ntime, or rupture it, or something. When the tale begins, we don’t have\\nexact answers about the enemy’s powers (that’s for our intrepid heroes to\\nfind out), but we have a solid hunch that it can see possible futures\\nthrough the eyes of specific humans, then treat them as, essentially, video\\ngame characters, following their progress through the nasty “adventure”\\nof the war, and making note of their tactical maneuvers, the better to\\nensure our collective extermination. \\nTom Cruise, who seems to be spending his fifties saving humanity,\\nplays Major William Cage, an Army public relations officer. Cage is a\\nsurprising choice for the role of hero. He’s never seen combat yet\\ninexplicably finds himself thrown into the middle of a ferocious battle that\\nwill decide the outcome of the war. The film begins with Cage en route to\\nEuropean command headquarters in London, waking up in the belly of a\\ntransport chopper. The rest of the movie may not be his dream per se, but\\nat various points it sure feels as though it is. The world is wracked by war.\\nMillions have died. Whole cities have been reduced to ash heaps. The\\nlandscapes evoke color newsreel footage from World War II, and much of\\nEdge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) | Roger Ebert\\nabout:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerebert.com%2Frevie...\\n1 of 4\\n2025-11-01, 12:44 p.m.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nthe combat seems lifted from that era as well. \\nWhen Cage meets the general in charge of that part of the world’s forces,\\nhe’s told he’s being sent right into this movie’s version of D-Day and is to\\nreport for duty immediately. No amount of protest by Cage can halt this\\nassignment, and soon after he joins his unit and learns the rudiments of\\nwearing combat armor (this is one of those science fiction films in which\\nsoldiers wear clumping bionic suits festooned with machine guns and\\nother weapons) he dies on the battlefield. Then he wakes up and starts all\\nover. Then he dies again and starts over again. He always knows he’s\\nbeen here before, that he met this person, said that thing, did that thing,\\nmade a wrong choice and died. Nobody else does, though. They’re\\noblivious to the way in which Cage, like “Slaughterhouse Five” hero Billy\\nPilgrim, has come unstuck in time. \\nCage’s only allies are a scientist (Noah Taylor) who believes the creatures\\nare beating humanity through their mastery of time, and Rita Vrataski\\n(Emily Blunt), an Audie Murphy or Sgt. York type who’s great for armed\\nforces morale in addition to being an exceptionally gifted killer. Rita has\\nexperienced the same temporal dislocation that Cage is now\\nexperiencing, but at a certain point it stopped. She recognizes his\\nmaddening condition but can no longer share in it. She can, however,\\noffer guidance (and a key bit of information that defines his predicament),\\nand speed up the learning curve by shooting him in the head whenever it\\nbecomes obvious that they’re going down a wrong road that’ll lead to the\\nsame fatal outcome. \\nAlthough the film’s advertising would never dare suggest such a thing, for\\nfear of driving off viewers who just want the bang bang-boom boom, Cage\\nis a complex and demanding role for any actor. It is especially right for\\nCruise, in that Cage starts out as a Jerry Maguire-type who’ll say or do\\nanything to preserve his comfort, then learns through hard (lethal)\\nexperience how to be a good soldier and a good man. He changes as the\\nstory tells and retells and retells itself. By the end he’s nearly\\nunrecognizable from the man we met in the opening. \\nEdge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) | Roger Ebert\\nabout:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerebert.com%2Frevie...\\n2 of 4\\n2025-11-01, 12:44 p.m.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 3**\\n\"\"\"\\nCruise is hugely appealing here, not just in the early scenes opposite\\nGleeson in which he’s in Tony Curtis mode—he’s always fantastic playing\\na smooth-talking manipulator who’s sweating on the inside—but later,\\nwhere he exhibits the sort of rock-solid super-competence and unforced\\ndecency that Randolph Scott brought to Budd Boetticher’s westerns. He\\nwas always likable, sometimes perfect in the right role, but age has\\ndeepened him by bringing out his vulnerability. There’s an existential\\nterror in his eyes that’s disturbing in a good way, and there are points in\\nwhich “Edge of Tomorrow” seems to simultaneously be about what it’s\\nabout while also being about the predicament of a real actor trying to stay\\nrelevant in a Hollywood universe that’s addicted to computer generated\\nmonsters, robots and explosions. Cruise deserves some sort of acting\\naward for the array of yelps and gasps he summons as he’s killed by a\\nMimic or shot in the head by Blunt and then rebooted into another version\\nof the story.\\nThe rest of the cast has less to do because this is Tom Cruise’s movie\\nthrough-and-through, but they’re all given moments of humor, terror or\\nsimple eccentricity. Taylor often gets cast as brilliant but haunted or\\nostracized geniuses, and he’s effective in another of those roles here.\\nGleeson, as is so often the case, invests a rather stock character with\\nsuch humanity that when the character’s motivations and responses\\nchange, you get the sense that it’s because the general is a good and\\nsmart man and not because he’s just doing what the script needs him to\\ndo. Emily Blunt is unexpectedly convincing as a fearless and elegant\\nsuper-soldier, and of course a magnificent camera subject as well.\\nDirector Doug Liman is so enamored with the introductory shot of her\\nrising up off the floor of a combat training facility in a sort of downward\\nfacing dog yoga pose that he repeats it many times. The film’s only\\negregious flaw is its attempt to superimpose a love story onto Cruse and\\nBlunt’s relationship, which seems more comfortable as a “Let’s express\\nour adoration for each other by killing the enemy” kind of thing. \\nThere’s no end to the number of films and novels and other sources to\\nwhich “Edge of Tomorrow” can be likened. “Groundhog Day” seems to be\\nEdge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) | Roger Ebert\\nabout:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerebert.com%2Frevie...\\n3 of 4\\n2025-11-01, 12:44 p.m.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 4**\\n\"\"\"\\neveryone’s reflexive comparison point, but Liman’s elaborately\\nchoreographed tracking shots and unglamorously visualized European\\nhellscapes evoke “Children of Men,” the creatures themselves have a\\ntouch of the Sentinels from the “Matrix” films, and the monsters-vs.-\\ninfantry scenes will remind you of James Cameron’s “Aliens” and its\\nliterary predecessor “Starship Troopers.” (Bill Paxton, one of the stars of\\n“Aliens,” plays Cage’s drill sergeant, a mustachioed Kentucky hard-ass\\nwith an amusingly sour sense of humor.)   It’s also an exceptionally brutal\\nfilm, so bone-and-skull-crushingly violent and fairy-tale frightening that its\\nPG-13 rating is stupefying. Parents should avoid taking young children\\nwho’ll be both confused by the fractured narrative and terrified of the\\nMimics, nightmare creatures that look like razor-tentacled squid and roll\\nacross the landscapes like tumbleweeds.\\nIn all, though, “Edge of Tomorrow” is its own thing. One of its most\\nfascinating qualities is its keen judgement of the audience’s learning\\ncurve. The early sections of the film repeat scenes and dialogue until you\\nget used to the idea of the story as a video game or movie script, but just\\nwhen you start to think, “Yes, I get it, let’s move on,” the film has in fact\\nmoved on and is now leaving things out because they’re not necessary.\\nBy the end of the movie the script—which is credited to Christopher\\nMcQuarrie and Jez and John Henry Butterworth—has gotten to the point\\nwhere it’s tactically withholding information and waiting for us to figure\\nthings out on our own. It repeats key images and lines near the end as\\nwell, but always for good reason. When you see the familiar material\\nagain you feel different about it, because its meaning has changed. The\\nmovie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of\\nlinear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it.  \\nEdge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) | Roger Ebert\\nabout:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rogerebert.com%2Frevie...\\n4 of 4\\n2025-11-01, 12:44 p.m.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
