Edge of Tomorrow movie review (2014) |
Roger Ebert
8–10 minutes
“Edge of Tomorrow” is less of a time travel movie than an experience
movie; that statement might not make sense now, but it probably will after
you’ve seen it. Based on Hiroshi Sikurazaka’s novel “All You Need is Kill”,
it’s <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a true science fiction film, highly conceptual</span>, set during the aftermath of
an alien invasion. Maybe “extra-dimensional being invasion” is more
accurate. The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fierce, octopod-looking beasties</span> known as Mimics are
controlled hive-mind style by a creature that seems able to peer through
time, or rupture it, or something. When the tale begins, we don’t have
exact answers about the enemy’s powers (that’s for our intrepid heroes to
find out), but we have a solid hunch that it can see possible futures
through the eyes of specific humans, then treat them as, essentially, video
game characters, following their progress through the nasty “adventure”
of the war, and making note of their tactical maneuvers, the better to
ensure our collective extermination. 
Tom Cruise, who seems to be spending his fifties saving humanity,
plays Major William Cage, an Army public relations officer. Cage is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a
surprising choice for the role of hero</span>. He’s never seen combat yet
inexplicably finds himself thrown into the middle of a ferocious battle that
will decide the outcome of the war. The film begins with Cage en route to
European command headquarters in London, waking up in the belly of a
transport chopper. The rest of the movie may not be his dream per se, but
at various points it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">sure feels as though it is</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The world is wracked by war</span>.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Millions have died</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Whole cities have been reduced to ash heaps</span>. The
landscapes evoke color newsreel footage from World War II, and much of

&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the combat seems lifted from that era as well</span>. 
When Cage meets the general in charge of that part of the world’s forces,
he’s told he’s being sent right into this movie’s version of D-Day and is to
report for duty immediately. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">No amount of protest by Cage can halt this
assignment</span>, and soon after he joins his unit and learns the rudiments of
wearing combat armor (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this is one of those science fiction films in which
soldiers wear clumping bionic suits festooned with machine guns and
other weapons</span>) <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he dies on the battlefield</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Then he wakes up and starts all
over</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Then he dies again and starts over again</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He always knows he’s
been here before</span>, that he met this person, said that thing, did that thing,
made a wrong choice and died. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Nobody else does, though</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They’re
oblivious to the way in which Cage, like “Slaughterhouse Five” hero Billy
Pilgrim, has come unstuck in time</span>. 
Cage’s only allies are a scientist (Noah Taylor) who believes the creatures
are beating humanity through their mastery of time, and Rita Vrataski
(Emily Blunt), an Audie Murphy or Sgt. York type who’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">great for armed
forces morale</span> in addition to being <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an exceptionally gifted killer</span>. Rita has
experienced the same temporal dislocation that Cage is now
experiencing, but at a certain point it stopped. She recognizes his
maddening condition but can no longer share in it. She can, however,
offer guidance (and a key bit of information that defines his predicament),
and speed up the learning curve by shooting him in the head whenever it
becomes obvious that they’re going down a wrong road that’ll lead to the
same fatal outcome. 
Although the film’s advertising would never dare suggest such a thing, for
fear of driving off viewers who just want the bang bang-boom boom, Cage
is a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">complex and demanding role</span> for any actor. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">especially right for
Cruise</span>, in that Cage starts out as a Jerry Maguire-type who’ll say or do
anything to preserve his comfort, then <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">learns through hard (lethal)
experience how to be a good soldier and a good man</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He changes as the
story tells and retells and retells itself</span>. By the end he’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nearly
unrecognizable from the man we met in the opening</span>.

&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cruise is hugely appealing here</span>, not just in the early scenes opposite
Gleeson in which he’s in Tony Curtis mode—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he’s always fantastic playing
a smooth-talking manipulator who’s sweating on the inside</span>—but later,
where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he exhibits the sort of rock-solid super-competence and unforced
decency</span> that Randolph Scott brought to Budd Boetticher’s westerns. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He
was always likable, sometimes perfect in the right role</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">age has
deepened him by bringing out his vulnerability</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There’s an existential
terror in his eyes that’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">disturbing in a good way</span></span>, and there are points in
which “Edge of Tomorrow” seems to simultaneously be about what it’s
about while also being about the predicament of a real actor trying to stay
relevant in a Hollywood universe that’s addicted to computer generated
monsters, robots and explosions. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cruise deserves some sort of acting
award for the array of yelps and gasps he summons</span> as he’s killed by a
Mimic or shot in the head by Blunt and then rebooted into another version
of the story.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The rest of the cast has less to do because this is Tom Cruise’s movie
through-and-through</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">they’re all given moments of humor, terror or
simple eccentricity</span>. Taylor often gets cast as brilliant but haunted or
ostracized geniuses, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he’s effective in another of those roles here</span>.
Gleeson, as is so often the case, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">invests a rather stock character with
such humanity</span> that when the character’s motivations and responses
change, you get the sense that it’s because the general is a good and
smart man and not because he’s just doing what the script needs him to
do. Emily Blunt is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">unexpectedly convincing as a fearless and elegant
super-soldier</span>, and of course <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a magnificent camera subject</span> as well.
Director Doug Liman is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">so enamored with the introductory shot</span> of her
rising up off the floor of a combat training facility in a sort of downward
facing dog yoga pose that he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">repeats it many times</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The film’s only
egregious flaw is its attempt to superimpose a love story onto Cruse and
Blunt’s relationship</span>, which seems more comfortable as a “Let’s express
our adoration for each other by killing the enemy” kind of thing. 
There’s no end to the number of films and novels and other sources to
which “Edge of Tomorrow” can be likened. “Groundhog Day” seems to be

&quot;&quot;&quot;
everyone’s reflexive comparison point, but Liman’s elaborately
choreographed tracking shots and unglamorously visualized European
hellscapes evoke “Children of Men,” the creatures themselves have a
touch of the Sentinels from the “Matrix” films, and the monsters-vs.-
infantry scenes will remind you of James Cameron’s “Aliens” and its
literary predecessor “Starship Troopers.” (Bill Paxton, one of the stars of
“Aliens,” plays Cage’s drill sergeant, a mustachioed Kentucky hard-ass
with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an amusingly sour sense of humor</span>.)   It’s also an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">exceptionally brutal
film</span>, so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">bone-and-skull-crushingly violent</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fairy-tale frightening</span> that its
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">PG-13 rating is stupefying</span>. Parents should avoid taking young children
who’ll be both <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">confused by the fractured narrative</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">terrified of the
Mimics</span>, nightmare creatures that look like razor-tentacled squid and roll
across the landscapes like tumbleweeds.
In all, though, “Edge of Tomorrow” is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">its own thing</span>. One of its most
fascinating qualities is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">its keen judgement of the audience’s learning
curve</span>. The early sections of the film repeat scenes and dialogue until <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you
get used to the idea of the story as a video game or movie script</span>, but just
when <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you start to think, “Yes, I get it, let’s move on,”</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the film has in fact
moved on and is now leaving things out because they’re not necessary</span>.
By the end of the movie the script—which is credited to Christopher
McQuarrie and Jez and John Henry Butterworth—has gotten to the point
where it’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">tactically withholding information and waiting for us to figure
things out on our own</span>. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">repeats key images and lines near the end</span> as
well, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">always for good reason</span>. When you see the familiar material
again <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you feel different about it</span>, because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">its meaning has changed</span>. The
movie has <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an organic intelligence</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a sense that it, too, exists outside of
linear time</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It seems to be creating itself as you watch it</span>.
