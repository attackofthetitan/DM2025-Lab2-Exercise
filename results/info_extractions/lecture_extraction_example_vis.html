        # LECTURE ANALYSIS: Outliers and Missing Values
## Video Segment: 134:00 - 138:28

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide discusses outliers, defining them as data objects with characteristics that are considerably different from most of the other data objects in the data set. It also shows a scatter plot with several clusters of data points and some points circled in red, presumably representing outliers.

[TRANSCRIPT - 134:00]
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Outliers are data objects with characteristics that are considerably different than most of the other data objects in the data set.</span> Noise is not sometimes not just noise because they can combine with many, many different things. And then actually they will make you to decide are they outlier or not outlier. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">So what is outlier? Outliers being considered they are not ordinary. They are different from others.</span> So for right now, you can actually see for this figure. Can you identify which one are outlier? You might say professor, you already say that there&#x27;s one who actually marks a red circle. Your data like this one. Right? But...

[TRANSCRIPT - 134:41]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">So sometimes to detect outlier from noise is kind of difficult too. So you really, really require a lot of understanding.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">And how do I know they are understanding? I don&#x27;t know. So then you actually need to check your problem, understand what&#x27;s the context, understand the background in order for you to make the correct hypothesis.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">You try the data to validate that hypothesis to see if that is correct or not. So that is how you try to process the data. Not just have the data and get everything out of it. Then you will find you spend a lot of GPU time trying out something that is not useful.</span>

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide transitions to &#x27;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Missing Values</span>&#x27;. It lists reasons for missing values, such as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">information not being collected (e.g., people declining to give their age and weight) and attributes not being applicable to all cases (e.g., annual income is not applicable to children).</span> It also has a section on handling missing values.

[TRANSCRIPT - 135:30]
Next one, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">missing value. Okay. Missing value is one that we say for example, you do not collect the information.</span> So then my answer will be you guessed. For example, can I ask me professor, what is your age? Then my answer will be you guess. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">So I&#x27;m not going to give you my age. But then, you know, I have some PhD student, he already graduate. Then he keep on guessing. Professor, I think you are this one. Is that correct? I say guess. Okay. So all you can say, maybe they are just noise. So it will be very possible that those information cannot be collected. And then there&#x27;s one thing is people intentionally not try to give that to you. Or then they have something is like certain attribute. You probably there&#x27;s no way for you to get that information because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">for example, right now you ask the children, what is their income? They don&#x27;t have that. So that is, it looks like missing, but actually that missing is reasonable.</span></span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">But then</span> so what the part is, how can you differentiate that null supposed to be null or then null supposed to be something you need to be collected. That is the problem for missing. Okay. How do you know? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">You need to also have your final, your hypothesis about that. You collect the income, then you need to thinking about the income probably, you know, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">there&#x27;s one year we do the KTV cup and then we try to know is any black money actually being delivered from the different account from one transaction to another. How do we know that is the black money? You need to make hypothesis. For example, age. And age make difference. Yes. Because they are going to get certain fake account or some account. So the student need to do a lot of understanding behind a word. Can be exist in front of different counter at the same time or not.</span></span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">So if you find out the evidence like this account actually show up at the different location of the ATM and about the same time, which mean they do have the gunner, right?</span> And so that part require people to understand about it. How do you know about that type, you need to put in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">spatial data</span> inside. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Depends on your hypothesis.</span>
